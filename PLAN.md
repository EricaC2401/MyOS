# Expense Tracker Development Plan

## Objective

Build a personal expense tracker for one user.
The app should be accessible from both MacBook and iPhone through a browser.
The app should store data in Supabase PostgreSQL and provide CSV export for backup.

The current stage is expense-only. Income support can be added later if requested.

## How to use this plan

This plan is a roadmap, not a single implementation task.

Work through the milestones in order unless instructed otherwise.
Each Codex task should normally cover one milestone only.
Do not implement future milestones early, because future milestones may change as the project develops.

Update this file only when:

- a milestone is completed
- milestone order changes
- scope changes
- acceptance criteria change
- a major technical decision changes

Do not add detailed implementation notes, full SQL schemas, or low-level code details here.
Detailed SQL should live in SQL migration files.
Detailed setup and usage instructions should live in `README.md`.

## V1 scope

### Included

- Manual transaction entry
- Basic category selection
- CSV export backup
- CSV import with duplicate warning
- Transaction view and filtering
- Basic reports
- Simple app-level password protection before deployment
- Deployment to Streamlit Community Cloud if suitable
- Expense-only tracking for the initial version

### Excluded

- Multi-user login
- Bank API or Open Banking integration
- OCR or receipt scanning
- AI categorisation
- Native mobile app
- Paid hosting or paid database features
- Advanced duplicate detection
- SQLite or local PostgreSQL version

## V1 technical direction

Use:

- Python 3.11+
- Streamlit
- Supabase PostgreSQL
- pandas
- psycopg2-binary
- pytest

Preferred hosting:

- Streamlit Community Cloud free tier

Preferred secrets method:

- Streamlit secrets locally and in deployment

Architecture:

```text
MacBook browser
        ↓
Streamlit app
        ↓
Supabase PostgreSQL
        ↑
iPhone browser
```

Supabase PostgreSQL is the single source of truth.
CSV export is the V1 backup method.

## Data model direction

The main table is `transactions`.

Required transaction fields:

- `id`
- `transaction_date`
- `description`
- `amount`
- `category`
- `payment_method`
- `notes`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

Rules:

- Store amounts as positive numbers.
- Default missing or blank categories to `Uncategorised`.
- The current stage tracks expenses only.
- Expense reports should treat stored amounts as spending.
- `updated_at` should be maintained by a PostgreSQL trigger or explicit application logic. Prefer a trigger for V1.

The exact PostgreSQL schema should be implemented in SQL migration files under `sql/`, not directly in this plan.

## Target project structure

This is the intended starting structure for V1 and may evolve slightly during implementation.

## M0 — Project setup

### Goal

Create the basic project structure.

### Codex tasks

- Create the target project folders and placeholder files.
- Create `README.md`.
- Create `requirements.txt` with the core packages.
- Create `.gitignore` covering secrets and local cache files.
- Create `.streamlit/secrets.toml.example`.
- Use the provided `sample_data/sample_expense.csv` as the example CSV for the project.

The sample expense CSV currently uses these columns:

`Date`, `Item`, `Expense Type`, `Tax Deductable`, `Expense (GBP)`, `Expense (HKD)`, `Note`, `Cash?`

### Done when

- Project structure matches the target layout.
- `requirements.txt` includes required packages.
- `.gitignore` excludes secrets and local files.
- `README.md` explains basic local setup.
- `pytest` runs without errors.

---

## M1 — Supabase database setup

### Goal

Prepare the Supabase PostgreSQL database and connect the app to it.

### Human tasks

- Create a Supabase account if needed.
- Create a Supabase project.
- Run the initial SQL migration in the Supabase SQL editor.
- Confirm database connection details are available.

### Codex tasks

- Create `sql/001_initial_schema.sql` for the initial schema.
- Add database connection logic in `src/db.py`.
- Use `@st.cache_resource` on the connection function.
- Add a simple connection test function.
- Add clear error handling if the connection fails.
- Update README with Supabase connection notes.
- Confirm real credentials are not committed to Git.

### Notes

Prefer the Supabase connection pooler, if appropriate, to reduce the risk of hitting free-tier connection limits.

### Done when

- Human tasks are confirmed complete by the user.
- The app can connect to Supabase PostgreSQL.
- Database credentials are not committed to Git.
- A connection test function exists, and a real connection is confirmed after the user completes the required human setup tasks.
- Initial SQL lives in `sql/001_initial_schema.sql`.
- `src/db.py` contains the connection logic with `@st.cache_resource`.

---

## M2 — Data validation and models

### Goal

Create basic validation for transaction data.

### Codex tasks

- Add transaction validation logic in `src/models.py`.
- Validate required fields.
- Reject negative amounts.
- Use `Uncategorised` if no category is provided.
- Normalise text fields where useful.
- Add tests in `tests/test_models.py`.

### Done when

- Valid data passes validation.
- Invalid data returns clear error messages.
- Negative amounts are rejected.
- Missing categories default to `Uncategorised`.
- Tests pass.

---

## M3 — Basic categories

### Goal

Create a simple category structure before manual entry, CSV import, and reports.

### Codex tasks

- Define a default category list in `src/categorisation.py`.
- Use `Uncategorised` when no category is provided.
- Add a helper function to return the category list.
- Do not implement keyword-based auto-categorisation yet.

Suggested default categories:

- Housing
- Groceries
- Car Related
- Transport
- Eating out
- Shopping
- Bills
- Subscriptions
- Healthcare
- Travel
- Income
- Other
- Uncategorised

For V1, the category list is defined in code. A UI for managing categories is not in scope.

### Done when

- Manual entries can use the default category list.
- Imported data can fall back to `Uncategorised`.
- Reports can group uncategorised transactions clearly.
- Category logic is available before CSV import and reports are built.

---

## M4 — Database functions

- Keep all SQL inside `src/db.py`.
- Use parameterised SQL only.
- Add simple handling for dropped connections.
- Show clear errors if Supabase is unavailable.
- Add tests where practical for database-facing logic, using mocks or isolated tests if a live database is not available.

### Done when

- Transactions can be inserted, fetched, updated, and deleted.
- `updated_at` updates correctly after edits.
- All database logic is inside `src/db.py`.
- No queries are placed directly inside `src/app.py`.
- Connection failures show useful errors.

- Show clear success and error messages.
- Keep the form simple and mobile-friendly.

### Done when

- User can add an expense manually.
- User can select from the default category list.
- Invalid input shows a helpful error message.

### Done when

- User can view and filter transactions.
- Uncategorised transactions are clearly visible.
- Table is readable on both devices.

---

## M7 — CSV export backup

### Goal

Allow the user to back up data as CSV before edit/delete is added.

### Codex tasks

- Add export function in `src/export_csv.py`.
- Add tests in `tests/test_export_csv.py`.
- Add a Streamlit download button.
- Export all transactions with all key fields.

### Goal

Allow the user to correct mistakes.

### Codex tasks

---

## M9 — CSV import

### Goal

### Expected CSV columns

The import format for the current stage is based on `sample_data/sample_expense.csv`.

### Codex tasks

- Add CSV upload in Streamlit.
- Add CSV cleaning logic in `src/import_csv.py`.
- Validate required columns, dates, and amounts.

### Goal

Make categorisation faster without using AI.

### Codex tasks

- Add keyword-based rules in `src/categorisation.py`.

- Netflix, Spotify → Subscriptions
- Amazon → Shopping
- Council Tax → Bills
- Rent → Housing

### Done when

- Imported transactions can be categorised faster using keyword rules.
- User can manually override the suggested category.
- Categorisation logic is in `src/categorisation.py`, not `src/app.py`.
- Uncategorised transactions are still handled clearly.
